**Learning:** Highlighting the "optimal" solution on a complex contour plot (like a Porkchop plot) significantly reduces the cognitive load for users who otherwise have to manually cross-reference the CLI text output with the visual graph.
**Action:** When a CLI tool calculates a specific "best" result and also generates a plot, always explicitly mark that result on the plot itself (e.g., with a star or distinct marker) to bridge the gap between analysis and visualization.
